.. _`Installation`:

Installation
============

Python Support
--------------

pip works with CPython versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and also pypy.


Using virtualenv
----------------

The easiest way to install and use pip is with `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org>`_, since every virtualenv has pip (and it's dependencies) installed into it
automatically.

This does not require root access or modify your system Python
installation. For instance::

    $ virtualenv my_env
    $ . my_env/bin/activate
    (my_env)$ pip install SomePackage

When used in this manner, pip will only affect the active virtual environment.

See the `virtualenv installation instructions <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/#installation>`_.

Installing Globally
-------------------

pip can be installed globally in order to manage global packages.
Often this requires the installation to be performed as root.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

A global install of pip requires either `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
or `distribute <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_ to be installed globally as well.

In many cases, these can be installed using your OS package manager.

See the `Distribute Install Instructions <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute/>`_ or the
`Setuptools Install Instructions <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions>`_

.. warning::

    If you are using Python 3.X you **must** use distribute; setuptools doesn't
    support Python 3.X.

Using get-pip
+++++++++++++

Download `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
and execute it using Python.  This will only install pip, not the prerequisites.

::

 $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
 $ [sudo] python get-pip.py


From source
+++++++++++

::

 $ curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-X.X.tar.gz
 $ tar xvfz pip-X.X.tar.gz
 $ cd pip-X.X
 $ [sudo] python setup.py install
